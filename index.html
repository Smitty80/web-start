    <!-- How Our Service Works -->
    <section class="how-it-works">
        <h2>How Our Service Works</h2>
        <p>Creating your website with <strong>Internet Presence</strong> is a straightforward, step-by-step process.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Client Guidance:</strong> You define the goals of your site and provide us with the content (text, images, and any other information you'd like).</li>
            <li><strong>Website Creation:</strong> We design and build a prototype of the website based on your specifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> There is <strong>no obligation</strong> to pay until you approve the prototype. Once approved, you’ll need to pay for the final website to be published.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The prototype will remain <strong>free</strong> until you’re satisfied, but once you’re ready to go live, the website becomes <strong>your sole property</strong> after payment.</p>

        <h3>Pricing:</h3>
        <p>The final price will be determined based on the scope of the work. The price of the prototype will be adjusted according to the amount of work needed for the completion of your site.</p>

        <h3>Domain & Hosting:</h3>
        <p>A <strong>domain name</strong> and <strong>hosting service</strong> are necessary to make your website live. You will need to purchase these, but we’re here to guide you through the process and publish the website for you. The ownership and control of the website remain <strong>with you</strong> once it’s paid for and published.</p>
    </section>
